# Welcome to the WubbaLubbaDubDub Frontend Project!
This frontend is gonna blow your mind harder than a trip to Anatomy Park, but without all the screaming children and bleeding spleens.

## What it does:
- It plumbs the depths of the Rick and Morty API, extracting precious character data like plumbuses from a Gromflomite's butt.
- It presents that data in a way that even Jerry could understand (well, maybe not Jerry).
- It's got more features than a Meseeks box, including filtering, sorting, and enough responsive design to make it work on any intergalactic device.

## How to use it:
Just click this portal link, Morty: https://douglasirrazabal.github.io/rick-and-morty
